# Retina Analysis

**Introduction:** Retinal imaging, the process of taking high-resolution images of the rear inner surface of the eye, is used by ophthalmologists to examine the eyes. Some of the features captured during this process are; the optic nerve, fovea, surrounding vessels, and the retinal layer.

**Project Goal:** - This project will be predicting the results of 400 retinal images. The images and labels were retrieved from [STructured Analysis of the Retina](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/) by M. Goldbaum, M.D., Professor of Ophthalmology in Residence, Shiley Eye Institute, and Adam Hoover, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University.

**Authors:** Osarodion Ogbebor Evans and Sheila Brooks 

**Notebook:** [retinaAnalysis notebook](retinaAnalysis.ipynb).

This project was completed under the supervision of by Prof. Vijayan Sugumaran, SBA, Oakland University.
