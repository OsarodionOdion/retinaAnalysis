# Retina Analysis

**Introduction:** Retinal imaging, the process of taking high-resolution images of the rear inner surface of the eye, is used by ophthalmologists to examine the eyes. Some of the features captured during this process are; the optic nerve, fovea, surrounding vessels, and the retinal layer.

**Project Goal** - This project will be predicting the results of 400 retinal images. The images and labels were retrieved from [STructured Analysis of the Retina](https://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/) by M. Goldbaum, M.D., Professor of Ophthalmology in Residence, Shiley Eye Institute, and Adam Hoover, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University.

The project was completed by Osarodion Ogbebor Evans and Sheila Brooks and is available in the [retinaAnalysis notebook](retinaAnalysis.ipynb).

The project was completed under the supervision of by Prof. Vijayan Sugumaran, SBA, Oakland University./n
The Cookie cutter used in placing this project under version control was created by Prof. Mark Isken, SBA, Oakland University.
